This plugin for [Obsidian] enables you to complement input in markdown files.

## ‚å®Ô∏èFeatures

### Current file complement

It complements the text with tokens that exists in a current file.

You can set a strategy if the separator of your language is not only whitespace.

You can add custom dictionaries from settings as follows.

![settings](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-various-complements-plugin/blob/main/demo/setting-custom-directories.png?raw=true)

- ‚ö† Absolute paths are not supported
- ‚ö† Relative paths **that point outside of Vault** are not supported
  - On desktop, it might work correctly but not supported, be careful :)

#### Definitions of a dictionary file

You can define a word for each line in dictionary files~~~~.

| Col1 | Col2        | Col3 and later |
| ---- | ----------- | -------------- |
| word | description | aliases        |

It uses `<TAB>` as a separator.

Ex.
```
Looks good to me		LGTM
As far as I know	spoken used to say that you think that something is true, although it is possible that you do not know all the facts or cannot remember completely	AFAIK
red	üî¥	color
blue	üîµ	color
green	üü¢	color
üòÑ		@smile @laugh @good
```

It is more straightforward to edit on Google Spread Sheet.
